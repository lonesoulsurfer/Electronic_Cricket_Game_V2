Build your own electronic, handheld cricket game! Cricket Test matches are known for being played over 5 days and sometimes there’s still not a winner – 5 days!!! In honor of the noble game, I decided to build my own electronic cricket match handheld game so I could play it anytime I wanted (with the added benefit of nice, quick matches)


The electronic game itself is pretty straight forward, score as many runs as possible before you go out! I usually give myself 3 outs before I call game over. There are a few cricket terms added to the board which will hopefully help anyone who is keen to learn a little more about the game. I've included a bit of a glossary in the last step and also instructions on how to play the game.


The board I designed in Eagle and all of the components are soldered directly to the board so no need for any messy wires. Version one was all done on prototype board and was a real pain. There were wires everywhere and it was glitchy. This new version was a breeze to put together and works perfectly.


If you are new to soldering then this project would be great to hone your soldering skills. I have provided all of the gerber files (the files you need to get your own board printed) and have provided a step below on how to get boards printed.
